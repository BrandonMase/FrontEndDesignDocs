# Functions

## Documentation Over Comments

In order to enhance code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers, it is crucial to prioritize documentation over comments when describing functions. This documentation standard adheres to the use of `JSDoc` to comprehensively document each function, detailing its purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. This proactive approach not only streamlines the development process but also serves as a valuable resource for future developers who may interact with your code.

### JSDoc Documentation

**Definition**: `JSDoc` is a markup language that allows developers to document their JavaScript code.

**Usage**: Utilize JSDoc to document functions, providing clear and structured information about their functionality and usage.

### Descriptive Naming Conventions

**Importance**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for functions that convey their purpose.

**Example:**

```ts
/**
 * Calculates the total sum of an array.
 *
 * @param numbers - An array of numbers to be summed.
 * @returns - The total sum of the array.
 */
function calculateTotalSum(numbers: Array<number>) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

### Advantages of Documentation Over Comments
### Enhanced Code Readability:

`JSDoc` documentation provides a clear and standardized way to convey the purpose and usage of functions, enhancing overall code readability.
Time Savings for Developers:

By documenting functions using `JSDoc`, developers save time when revisiting their own code or when sharing code with other team members. The documentation serves as a quick reference.

**Facilitates Code Maintenance**

Comprehensive documentation reduces the learning curve for developers maintaining or extending existing code, as they can quickly understand the purpose and expected behavior of functions.
Implementation Guidelines
Function Documentation:

Document each function using `JSDoc` comments, including a description of the function's purpose, input parameters, and return values.

**Example**


```ts
/**
 * Short description of the function.
 *
 * @param paramName - Description of the parameter.
 * @returns - Description of the return value.
 */
function functionName(paramName:arugmentType) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

### Update Documentation Consistently

Whenever a function's behavior or signature is modified, update the corresponding `JSDoc` documentation to reflect these changes.

Prioritizing documentation over comments through the use of `JSDoc` ensures that functions are well-documented, promoting code clarity, collaboration, and long-term maintainability. This approach not only benefits the current development team but also serves as a valuable resource for future developers who may need to understand, use, or modify the code. Remember, documentation is an investment in the future understanding of your code.
