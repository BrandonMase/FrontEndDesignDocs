# Preventing Mutation in Pass-by-Reference Variables

This documentation provides guidance on when to use [`Object.freeze`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) in JavaScript. `Object.freeze` is a method that prevents the modification of an [pass-by-reference variable](#1-definitions), making it immutable. Understanding the appropriate scenarios for using this method is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing unintended changes within your application.

### 1. **Definitions**
  - **Pass-by-Reference Variables**:
  `Objects`, `arrays`, and `functions` are examples of pass-by-reference variables in JavaScript.
  When these variables are assigned to another variable or passed as function arguments, the reference to the original variable is shared.

  - **`Object.freeze`**: `Object.freeze` is a method in JavaScript that prevents modifications to an object, making it immutable.

  - **Strict Mode**: [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime.

### 2. **Benefits**
  - **Immutability Assurance:**
  `Object.freeze` is employed to ensure that an object remains immutable, preventing the addition, deletion, or modification of its properties.

  - **Data Integrity Protection:**
   Utilize `Object.freeze` when you want to protect the integrity of certain data structures, ensuring that their state remains constant throughout their lifecycle.

  - **Functional Programming Principles:** 
  In functional programming paradigms, immutability is often emphasized. `Object.freeze` can be employed to adhere to these principles and facilitate the creation of pure functions.

### 3. **Drawbacks**
  - **Only Shallow Freeze**: 
  `Object.freeze` is shallow, meaning it only freezes the top-level object and its immediate properties. Nested objects must be frozen separately for complete immutability.

  - **Performance Implications:**
  While `Object.freeze` helps ensure immutability, it comes with a performance cost. Consider whether the trade-off between immutability and performance is acceptable for your specific use case.

### 4. **Best Practices**
  - **Data Integrity Protection:**
   Utilize `Object.freeze` when you want to protect the integrity of certain data structures, ensuring that their state remains constant throughout their lifecycle.

  - **Freezing Objects at Design Time:**
  Consider using `Object.freeze` during the design phase or when initializing objects to establish an immutable state from the outset.


### 5. **When To Break The Standard**
*N/A*

### 6. **Examples**
  - **Freezing an Object Literal:**
  ```javascript
  const user = {
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Doe',
  };

  // Freeze the user object
  Object.freeze(user);

  // Attempt to modify the frozen object
  user.age = 30;  // This assignment will be silently ignored in strict mode
  ```

  - **Freezing an Object at Design Time:**
  ```javascript
  function createImmutableUser(id, name) {
      const user = { id, name };

      // Freeze the user object during creation
      Object.freeze(user);

      return user;
  }

  const immutableUser = createImmutableUser(1, 'Jane Doe');
  ```

  - **Using `Object.freeze` in a Function:**
  ```javascript
  const database = {
      users: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
  };

  function getUsers() {
      // Ensure the integrity of the data by freezing the object before returning it
      return Object.freeze([...database.users]);
  }

  // Any attempt to modify the returned array will result in an error
  const users = getUsers();
  users.push('David');  // This operation will throw an error
  ```
