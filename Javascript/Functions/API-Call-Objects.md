# Creating Objects from API Responses

This emphasizes the best practice of having API call functions create their own objects based on the responses received from the API. It promotes modularity, encapsulation, and clear separation of concerns in the application architecture.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Object Creation from API Responses:**
   - **Best Practice:** API call functions should be responsible for creating objects based on the data received from the API. This approach ensures encapsulation and modularity, allowing for easier maintenance and adaptability.

### 2. **Modularity and Encapsulation:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - **Encapsulation:** Creating objects within API call functions encapsulates the logic related to the API response format, reducing dependencies in other parts of the codebase.
     - **Modularity:** Each API call function becomes a self-contained unit responsible for handling its specific data structure.

### 3. **Example:**

```ts
// API call function creating an object based on the API response
const getUserData_API = (userId: string) => {
    try {
        const RESPONSE = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        const USER_DATA:IGetUserDataResponse = await RESPONSE.json();

        // Create and return a user object
        return createUserObject(USER_DATA);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Function to create a user object
const createUserObject = (userData: IGetUserDataResponse)=> {
    return {
        id: userData.id,
        username: userData.username,
        email: userData.email,
        // Additional properties and logic as needed
    } as UserData;
}
```

In this example, `getUserData_API` is responsible for making the API call, and `createUserObject` encapsulates the logic of creating a user object based on the API response.

### 4. **Benefits:**
   - **Code Readability:**
     - **Advantage:** Creating objects within API call functions enhances code readability by centralizing the object creation logic in a dedicated function.

   - **Adaptability:**
     - **Advantage:** The approach allows for easy adaptation to changes in the API response format without affecting other parts of the codebase. If the API response structure evolves, the codebase remains unaffected, with the only required modification in the `createUserObject` function.
     - If the API response changes tomorrow, such as renaming `id` to `userId` and `email` to `emailAddress`, the impact on the codebase is minimal.

## Conclusion

Creating objects from API responses within the API call functions is a recommended practice that enhances code modularity, encapsulation, and readability. By following this approach, developers can create maintainable and adaptable code that efficiently handles changes in the API response format.
